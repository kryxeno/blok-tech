# Target Audience

The target audience for this app is people in the job market. This can be a company that is posting a job application, or an individual who is looking for a job.

# Individual

Individuals only want to see the jobs that match their criteria. This can include job field, salary, parttime/fulltime, etc..

I myself have used these services and I find that it is very important to be able to rule out unnecessary posts. Otherwise you are just wasting your time.

# Company

This is usually an HR representative or team manager that is making the job posting and the one who will be using the app to filter through the various applicants.

They want to get a good feel for an applicant, along with any degrees and/or certifications.
