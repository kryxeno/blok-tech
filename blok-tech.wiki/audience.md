# Target Audience

The target audience for this app is people in the job market. This can be a company that is posting a job application, or an individual who is looking for a job.

# Individual

Individuals only want to see the jobs that match their criteria. This can include job field, salary, parttime/fulltime, etc..

I myself have used these services and I find that it is very important to be able to rule out unnecessary posts. Otherwise you are just wasting your time.

The individual looks like this:

- A person looking for a job
- Likes finding interesting job opportunities
- Enjoys crafting their application to stand out
- Is done with finding a job the 'normal' way

Looking for a job takes up a lot of your time. Having to comb through all kinds of applications can be very tiring when doing it for a longer period. They want it to be easy and effective. Similar to a specialized recruitment agency.

So the individual is looking for speed and ease of use.

# Company

This is usually an HR representative or team manager that is making the job posting and the one who will be using the app to filter through the various applicants.

They want to get a good feel for an applicant, along with any degrees and/or certifications.

There is currently a big demand for workers of all types (in the Netherlands), and companies are getting more and more desparate.

Their goal is to see if the person is a liability or an asset, along with their qualifications. If both are positive, this person can be deemed a proper candidate.
