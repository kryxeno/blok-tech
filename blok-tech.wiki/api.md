# API's

# Web API

I will look at what web API's I have used after I finished the project.

I will probably use the url API for queries, touch API, dom API and pointer events API.

# Third Party API

I will use the Fakerjs third party api to populate my database with fake people.
I am going to use this api because I have used it at work in the past, and I don't want to fill my own database by hand.
I want to add a button that adds more potential applicants to simulate real-life conditions.
With this API you can basically call a function that randomly generates a piece of data for you, and they have a library of different types.
You need to call the API for each individual field, and I don't think node bundles those calls together. In that case I did make multiple calls.
This API doesn't require any authentication.
