# Templating

I researched PUG and EJS, and I ultimately chose EJS.

I picked EJS because it is somewhat similar to Django (a python templating engine). This is because I used Django during my internship. It also had a bit more documentation in the hva repo.
I like how you can pass data to the engine, how you can extend templates and that you can write inline logic is a nice bonus.

I have a good amount of extra packages.

I have express, eslint, nodemon, sass, axios, css-init, lodash and obviously mongo.
