# Version Control

I don't really use version control for an application of this size. Even though version control and branching is a vital part of development in a team, I don't feel like there is a added benefit to implementing it for a 1 person, sequential development process.

# Committing

In my commit messages I usually outline what has changed in the committed version. For example 'added api route for ####' or 'fixed bugs in feature #'.
I usually commit when I have finished a sub-task, or when the day is coming to an end.
When working with tickets and points (at my work) I also update the ticket with a branchname and/or url for the page.

# CLI

I use the command line to navigate in my folders, to git branch or stash (things like that), use make commands or managing docker containers.
For pushing, committing, etc.. I use the vscode version control tab (I think its way faster than CLI).

I use SSH keys, and have not had any merge conficts (as I am not merging multiple branches).
