# Local Dev Environment

# Editor

Before CMD I used sublime text 3 (because I saw it in a tutorial once). I currently use VSCode like everyone else.

I use the standard font and the theme that I use is 'SynthWave '84'.

I use about 40 extensions that I use for school or work. The ones I rely on most are probably prettier/prettiereslint, all the code snippets extensions and recently decided to get copilot. The all time top extension is probably git lens so that I can see which coworker to can blame when I see bad code :) (or if I don't understand something I know who to ask).

Yeah I have a custom prettier setup, but I use the standard linting setup. For most projects at work I just use the settings in the repo.

I dont think I have any custom dot files (unless you mean .env or .gitignore).
I haven't really customized my CLI.
