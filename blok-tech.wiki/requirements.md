# Requirements List

The feature I will develop is: "When I see multiple users, I want to match or ignore the users so that I can potentially match with the right person".
In order to define what this feature needs and what is optional, I have made a requirements list. I can look back on this during the development of the application to see whether or not I am on the right track (I should first be working on the must tasks).

The application must...

1. ...let companies see the applicants of their job post
2. ...let companies ignore applications
3. ...let companies save applications
4. ...let companies see the saved applications
5. ...function without Javascript
6. ...function without Javascript and CSS

The application should...

1. ...let users filter through job postings
2. ...let users apply for job postings

The application could...

1. ...have the possibility to favorite an application or post
2. ...have the possibility to see a match history

The application won't have...

1. ...the possibility to make a cv or job post
2. ...the possibility to login or manage an account
